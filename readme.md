# OSMAND Strava Heatmap

This browser extension makes it easy to use the [Strava Global Heatmap][1] in OSMAND.

Accessing this imagery externally requires a set of key parameters that you obtain
by signing into the Strava website. The keys expire after a
week or so at which point you must repeat the process of getting the keys and forming the signed url.
